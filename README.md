Siemens PPCL: User Defined Language for Notepad++

## Color Scheme
The color scheme is based on 'londontube.light' from
[terminal.sexy](https://terminal.sexy). I chose this because it uses a
pure white background, which most users of Notepad++ will be used to,
and I think it looks quite nice.

## Installation

The easiest way to install is to use the User Defined Language GUI.
First download the siemens-ppcl.xml file from this repository.  Using
the menus, go to *Language > Define your language... > Import*.  Find
the siemens-ppcl.xml you downloaded, and open that.

Close and restart Notepad++. When you open it back up, you should see
*Siemens PPCL* underneath *Define your language*. Click that and you
should see your file highlighted!

## Associated File Extension

I'm not sure that I've come across a global standard extension for these
files. I've chosen *.ppcl* to be the general extension for files in this
language. If the file ends with *.ppcl*, it should automatically be
highlighted with the logic in this file. If you prefer a different
default extension, it is easy to change in the User Defined Language
editor (it's at the top to the right of the *Import...* and *Export*
buttons).
